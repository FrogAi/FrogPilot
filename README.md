What is openpilot?
------

[openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot) is an open source driver assistance system. Currently, openpilot performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) for a growing variety of [supported car makes, models, and model years](docs/CARS.md). In addition, while openpilot is engaged, a camera-based Driver Monitoring (DM) feature alerts distracted and asleep drivers. See more about [the vehicle integration](docs/INTEGRATION.md) and [limitations](docs/LIMITATIONS.md).

  <summary>Toggles</summary>
  <blockquote>
    <details>
      <summary>Enable openpilot</summary>
      <p>Use the openpilot system for adaptive cruise control and lane keep driver assistance. Your attention is required at all times to use this feature. Changing this setting takes effect when the car is powered off.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Experimental Mode</summary>
      <p>openpilot defaults to driving in <strong>chill mode</strong>. Experimental mode enables <strong>alpha-level features</strong> that aren't ready for chill mode. Experimental features are listed below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>End-to-End Longitudinal Control:</strong> Let the driving model control the gas and brakes. openpilot will drive as it thinks a human would, including stopping for red lights and stop signs. Since the driving model decides the speed to drive, the set speed will only act as an upper bound. This is an alpha quality feature; mistakes should be expected.</li>
        <li><strong>New Driving Visualization</strong> The driving visualization will transition to the road-facing wide-angle camera at low speeds to better show some turns. The Experimental mode logo will also be shown in the top right corner. When a navigation destination is set and the driving model is using it as input, the driving path on the map will turn green.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Driving Personality</summary>
      <p>Standard is recommended. In aggressive mode, openpilot will follow lead cars closer and be more aggressive with the gas and brake. In relaxed mode openpilot will stay further away from lead cars. On supported cars, you can cycle through these personalities with your steering wheel distance button.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Enable Lane Departure Warnings</summary>
      <p>Receive alerts to steer back into the lane when your vehicle drifts over a detected lane line without a turn signal activated while driving over 31 mph (50 km/h).</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Record and Upload Driver Camera</summary>
      <p>Upload data from the driver facing camera and help improve the driver monitoring algorithm.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Use Metric System</summary>
      <p>Display speed in km/h instead of mph.</p>

How to Install
------

Easiest way to install FrogPilot is via this URL at the installation screen:

```
frogpilot.download
```

DO NOT install the "FrogPilot-Development" branch. I'm constantly breaking things on there, so unless you don't want to use openpilot, NEVER install it!
